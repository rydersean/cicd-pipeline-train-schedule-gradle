// I don't understand why you would need build.dependsOn npm_build when build already depends on zip? So I commented out build.dependsOn npm_build and ran ./gradlew build. It seems to build fine so I am going to leave it commented out when I push back to git.
// build.dependsOn npm_build 
npm_build.dependsOn npmInstall

// Note: You can't have your dependencies formatted like this where they are all in one line, you will get a build error. I have commented this out and formatted them on new lines shown above.
